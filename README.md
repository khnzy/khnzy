<h3>About Me</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Hi, I’m <strong>Khwnasat Giri Narzary</strong>, an MCA candidate with a background in data analytics and transitioning into product management.
I enjoy working at the intersection of <strong>users, data, and decisions</strong>—. Understanding real problems, exploring user behavior, and translating insights into practical,  product ideas.
</p>

<p>
My experience includes product discovery, user journey analysis, MVP scoping, and defining success metrics, supported by strong foundations in SQL, Python, and analytics.
I’m currently focused on learning how products are built and scaled end-to-end through cross functional collaboration.
